Part 1:
********



Part 2:
********



Part 3:
********
- Read the exercise description.
- Solve it, I started with figure 6, because it looked very similar to plant_05 -> first guess was directly correct.
- Solved the others with smart try and error, 3, 4 and 5. 3 and 4 were easy, 5 took some iteration to get to the solution.


Part 4:
********
- Pseudocode
- How do I get the probabilities and their expansions?
  -> Use of cout messages, to navigate in iterator based extraction setup.
- How extract element in range vector (stores lower and upper probability border) where the dice probability fits in?
  -> Recap iterator with lambda expressions from slids of C++ course.
- Google how to get index of iterator -> std::distance
- Done.
